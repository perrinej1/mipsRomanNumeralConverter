# Mips Roman Numeral Converter

This repo contains a roman numeral converter written in the mips assembly language.
The program was for a project in a CSCI 210, Machine Learning and Organization, course.
I've added the program file to this repo.
The program prompts the user to enter any roman numeral, and will convert the numeral
to decimal notation. If the user enters an incorrect numeral, the program will ask
the user to enter a new one. If a user wants to exit, they type 0.
